		<p>Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. Bender, quit destroying the universe!</p>
		<p><a href="http://www.ifc.com/portlandia/" target="_blank">portland</a> Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Do a flip!</p>

		<p>You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack!  I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. You wouldn't. Ask anyway!</p>
